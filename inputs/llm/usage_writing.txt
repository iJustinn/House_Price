The setup for the Multiple Regression model is straightforward, with direct relationships between the independent variables (Year and NumBedroom) and the dependent variable (house price). This model assumes that these relationships are linear and additive.
The setup for the Multiple Regression model is straightforward, positing direct linear and additive relationships between the independent variables (Year and NumBedroom) and the dependent variable (house price). This model assumes that changes in the year and the number of bedrooms are directly proportional to changes in house prices, with each independent variable contributing additively to the predicted price.

In contrast, the Polynomial Regression model requires a more intricate setup. It involves creating polynomial transformations of the independent variables to allow the model to fit non-linear trends. Specifically, the second-degree polynomial terms are created to model the curvature in the data, accounting for the possibility that the effect of time and the number of bedrooms on house prices changes at different rates. This setup acknowledges that increases in house prices may accelerate or decelerate over time and that the price premium for additional bedrooms may not be constant but could increase or decrease with the number of bedrooms.

The Generalized Additive Model (GAM) represents a flexible approach to modeling complex, non-linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables. This Model does not really have a fixed equation with coefficients due to its use of smoothing functions. The setup for the GAM model in this study involves specifying the smooth functions of the predictors, year and number of bedrooms, allowing for the accommodation of non-linear trends that cannot be captured by traditional linear models. Unlike polynomial regression, which explicitly models non-linearity through polynomial terms, GAM uses smoothing functions that are fitted to the data in a non-parametric manner. This approach enables the model to adapt to the shape of the underlying trend without pre-specifying the form of the relationship, thus providing a tailored fit to the peculiarities in the data.

This setup accommodates non-linear trends that traditional linear models fail to capture.

Unlike polynomial regression, which directly incorporates non-linearity through polynomial terms, GAM utilizes smoothing functions that are fitted to the data in a non-parametric way. This method enables the model to conform to the underlying trend's shape, providing a tailored fit to specific patterns and anomalies in the data. This adaptability makes GAM particularly useful for exploring and understanding the nuanced behaviors of variables within complex datasets.

The Multiple Regression model reveals some intriguing insights about the housing market. It shows a substantial negative intercept, suggesting that starting from the model's baseline (which may be the earliest year in the data, though not directly interpretable), the house prices are initially low. The positive coefficient for 'Year' implies that there's a general trend of increasing house prices over time. Every passing year is associated with an increase in the average house price, as indicated by the coefficient of 6,958.769. Additionally, the 'NumBedroom' variable carries a positive coefficient of 59,897.327, which suggests that houses with more bedrooms tend to have higher prices. This model accounts for 44.5% of the variability in house prices (R-squared = 0.445), which is respectable but indicates that over half of the variance is explained by factors not included in the model.

Switching to the Polynomial Regression model, the positive intercept is considerably high, indicating that the baseline price for houses at the starting point of the model is substantial. The inclusion of polynomial terms for 'Year' and 'NumBedroom' indicates a non-linear relationship between these variables and house prices. The positive coefficients for the polynomial terms of 'Year' suggest an initial increase in prices, but as the magnitude of the coefficients for the quadratic terms is lower, this might indicate a slowing growth rate or a potential future downturn in prices. The coefficients for 'NumBedroom' follow a similar pattern, hinting that the increase in price associated with additional bedrooms becomes less pronounced as the number of bedrooms increases. This model fits the data slightly better than the Multiple Regression model, as evidenced by a higher R-squared value of 0.479. The lower AIC and BIC values suggest it is more efficient, and the reduced RMSE indicates improved prediction accuracy.

The results of the GAM model as shown in Table 6 indicate a significant positive intercept, similar to the polynomial regression model, suggesting a high base price for the houses at the starting point. The R-squared value of 0.506 is an improvement over the linear models, explaining approximately 50.6% of the variability in house prices. This is indicative of the GAM's superior capability to capture the variance in house prices with its non-linear approach.
The results of the Generalized Additive Model (GAM), as detailed in Table 6, reveal a significant positive intercept, similar to the polynomial regression model, which suggests a high base price for houses at the starting point of the analysis. The R-squared value of 0.506 marks an improvement over the linear and polynomial models, explaining approximately 50.6% of the variability in house prices. This higher R-squared value is indicative of the GAM's enhanced ability to capture the variance in house prices due to its non-linear approach.

The GAM’s use of smooth functions allows it to model complex, non-linear relationships more effectively than traditional regression models, adapting to intricate patterns in the data. This capability makes it particularly useful for analyzing variables that do not have a straightforward linear impact on the dependent variable, thereby providing a more accurate and insightful understanding of the factors influencing house prices.

The AIC and BIC values are slightly lower than those in the polynomial regression model, which implies that the GAM provides a better model fit with less information loss. However, the reduction is not as substantial, suggesting that while the GAM improves upon the fit of linear models, it may not be drastically different in terms of information criteria.

The RMSE of the GAM is slightly lower than that of the multiple regression but higher than that of the polynomial regression, indicating that the model's predictions are reasonably accurate, although there might be some room for improvement. This metric confirms that while the GAM has enhanced the model's predictive capability, it does so in a way that is comparable but not necessarily superior to the polynomial approach, potentially due to the complexity and variability inherent in housing market data.
The results of the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) as presented in Table 6 show a significant positive intercept, mirroring the polynomial regression model, which suggests a high base price for houses at the outset of the analysis. The R-squared value of 0.506 represents an improvement over the linear models, explaining approximately 50.6% of the variability in house prices. This indicates the GAM's enhanced ability to capture the variance in house prices through its non-linear approach.

The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values for the GAM are slightly lower than those observed in the polynomial regression model, suggesting that the GAM provides a better model fit with less information loss. However, the marginal reduction in these values implies that while the GAM enhances the fit of the linear models, the improvement in terms of information criteria is not dramatically significant.

The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the GAM is lower than that of the multiple regression but higher than that observed in the polynomial regression, indicating that the model's predictions are reasonably accurate, yet there may be some potential for enhancement. This metric confirms that the GAM has improved the predictive capability of the model, providing an accuracy that is comparable, but not necessarily superior, to the polynomial approach. This performance might reflect the complexities and variabilities inherent in the housing market data, which can challenge even sophisticated models like the GAM.

Furthermore, two charts in @fig-GAM_fit each showing the smoothed relationship between the predictor and the response variable (house price), with a solid line representing the estimated function and dashed lines indicating the confidence interval around the estimate.

The plot on the left shows the relationship between 'Year' and house prices. There’s a clear non-linear trend. The prices appear to have a cyclical pattern with a significant peak around 2006, followed by a sharp decline, which likely corresponds to the global financial crisis of 2008. After this trough, there’s a recovery with prices trending upwards again, but with a suggestion of leveling off towards the end of the period. This could indicate a stabilization in the market or potentially the beginning of another downturn.

The plot on the right shows the relationship between 'NumBedroom' and house prices. This relationship is more straightforward: as the number of bedrooms increases, so does the house price. The upward trend appears to be exponential rather than linear, suggesting that additional bedrooms have an increasingly positive effect on house prices. The confidence interval widens with the number of bedrooms, indicating more variability in the data for houses with more bedrooms, which could be due to fewer observations in the higher bedroom categories or greater variance in prices for larger homes.

Both plots reveal the flexibility of GAMs in modeling complex relationships, allowing for the identification of trends that simpler linear models could miss. The confidence intervals suggest the model is fairly confident about its estimates, especially for the 'NumBedroom' variable. However, the wider intervals at the extremes of the data range would call for cautious interpretation in those areas.

In comparing the Multiple Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Generalized Additive Model (GAM) applied to the housing market data, each model serves a distinct purpose based on the complexity of the relationships it can capture between the predictors and the house prices.

The Multiple Regression model, with its linear approach, is the most straightforward, offering a baseline model for comparison. It is the least complex and most transparent, which makes it a good starting point for analysis but also the most limited in capturing the nuanced behavior of the housing market. The Polynomial Regression model advances this analysis by introducing non-linearity through polynomial terms, providing a significantly better fit as evidenced by its improved R-squared value and lower information criteria scores. It acknowledges and captures the more intricate patterns in housing prices related to time and property features.

GAM takes flexibility a step further, not being constrained by predefined polynomial terms, which allows for an even more nuanced understanding of the data. This model adapts to the data's inherent trends through the use of smoothing functions, leading to an improved R-squared value compared to the Multiple Regression model. However, when compared to Polynomial Regression, the gains in model performance are modest. While the GAM model offers a refined approach, it does not significantly outperform the Polynomial Regression in terms of the information criteria and RMSE, suggesting that the increased complexity of GAM may not be necessary for this particular dataset.

However, the visual representation of data trends provided by @fig-GAM_fit is not just intuitively appealing but also offers practical insights that might be obscured in tabular regression outputs. For example, the cyclical pattern observed in the 'Year' graph aligns with known economic events that affected housing prices, demonstrating GAM's capacity to capture externalities and temporal dynamics beyond the reach of conventional linear models.

Ultimately, the choice between these models should be informed by the balance between the need for model simplicity and the desire to capture complex data relationships. While the Polynomial Regression strikes a balance offering a good fit without overly complicating the model, the GAM provides the most flexibility, which could be essential for more intricate datasets or where the precise nature of relationships between variables is less understood.

However, the gains in model performance when compared to the Polynomial Regression are modest. While the GAM offers a refined approach, it does not significantly outperform the Polynomial Regression in terms of information criteria and RMSE, suggesting that the increased complexity of the GAM may not be necessary for this particular dataset.

Nevertheless, the visual representation of data trends provided by @fig-GAM_fit offers practical insights that might be obscured in tabular regression outputs. For example, the cyclical pattern observed in the 'Year' graph aligns with known economic events that affected housing prices, demonstrating GAM's ability to capture externalities and temporal dynamics beyond what conventional linear models can offer.

Ultimately, the choice between these models should be informed by the balance between the need for simplicity and the desire to capture complex data relationships. While the Polynomial Regression strikes a balance, offering a good fit without overly complicating the model, the GAM provides the most flexibility, which could be crucial for analyzing more intricate datasets or where the precise nature of relationships between variables is less understood.

Thank you for reminding me! Here's the revised response without the restricted words:

In comparing the Multiple Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Generalized Additive Model (GAM) applied to housing market data, each model serves a distinct purpose based on the complexity of the relationships it can capture between the predictors and house prices.

The Multiple Regression model, with its linear approach, offers a straightforward baseline for comparison. It is the simplest and most transparent, making it an ideal starting point for analysis. However, it is also the most limited in capturing the nuanced behaviors of the housing market. The Polynomial Regression model extends this analysis by introducing non-linearity through polynomial terms, which significantly improves the fit as evidenced by its higher R-squared value and lower information criteria scores. This model captures more intricate patterns in housing prices related to time and property features.

The GAM further enhances flexibility, not being constrained by predefined polynomial terms, which allows for an even more nuanced understanding of data trends. This model adapts to inherent trends in the data through the use of smoothing functions, leading to an improved R-squared value over the Multiple Regression model. However, the gains in model performance when compared to the Polynomial Regression are modest.

The Generalized Additive Model (GAM) offers a flexible method for modeling complex, non-linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables. Unlike models that rely on fixed equations with coefficients, GAM employs smoothing functions, allowing it to adapt dynamically to the data without a predefined formula. Also GAM has been proved show good fit for house price market [@citeGAM].In this study, the setup for the GAM involves specifying smooth functions for the predictors, namely year and number of bedrooms. This setup accommodates non-linear trends that traditional linear models fail to capture.

The consistent ascent of housing prices documented in this research echoes global economic patterns [@citeGlobalHP] that pervade developed countries. This upward trajectory is not an isolated event but part of a broader phenomenon observable across international borders, signifying a confluence of macroeconomic and microeconomic factors at play. The research underscores the deep interconnection between the housing market and overarching global economic conditions, reflecting on the intrinsic link between real estate value and global economic health.

The price increase might synchronous with inflationary trends that affect a myriad of economic sectors, suggesting that housing markets are not immune to the waves created by global monetary policy and financial climates. These inflationary pressures can often distort the purchasing power of consumers, leading to a complex dynamic where rising prices may not necessarily correlate with increases in actual property value. The dataset also indicates that demographic changes, especially family structures change (more members in each family), play a significant role in shaping demand and, consequently, prices in the housing market.

Further, the continuing increasing house price in US has promoted an interesting topic to study. As other paper shown, the GPD of US has not see a clear growth for a long time [@citeUSGDP], it is normal to assume that people not gonna buy more if they did not earn more, but the increasing hosue price is contridicting this fact.
The consistent rise in housing prices documented in this research parallels global economic patterns observed across developed nations [@citeGlobalHP]. This upward trend is not an isolated phenomenon but part of a broader pattern evident across international borders, highlighting a confluence of macroeconomic and microeconomic factors. This research emphasizes the deep interconnection between the housing market and global economic conditions, illustrating the intrinsic relationship between real estate values and global economic health.

The escalation in prices may coincide with inflationary trends affecting various economic sectors, suggesting that housing markets are susceptible to the impacts of global monetary policies and financial climates. These inflationary pressures can distort consumer purchasing power, creating a complex scenario where rising prices may not necessarily reflect actual increases in property value. The data also suggests that demographic shifts, particularly changes in family structures with more members per household, significantly influence demand and, consequently, prices in the housing market.

Furthermore, the continued increase in house prices in the US has spurred an intriguing area of study. As other research indicates, the GDP of the US has not seen clear growth for an extended period [@citeUSGDP]. It would typically be assumed that without increased earnings, consumer purchasing would not rise; however, the rising house prices contradict this expectation. This discrepancy poses critical questions about the factors driving housing market dynamics, independent of direct economic growth.

The surge in pricing for larger homes, as evidenced by the data, signals a potential shift in housing preferences, hinting at a burgeoning demand for more generous living spaces. This inclination towards spaciousness may be a reverberation from recent global events, notably the pandemic, which brought to the forefront the concept of home as a multifunctional space—a sanctuary, an office, and a recreation area rolled into one. As individuals and families have reevaluated their living arrangements, the quest for extra space has intensified, reflecting not only a desire for comfort but also for adaptability in home design to accommodate work-from-home arrangements, virtual schooling, and indoor leisure activities.

The implication of this potential shift is profound, extending beyond individual household decisions into the realms of urban planning and infrastructure development. Urban areas, traditionally characterized by high-density living and smaller residential units, may face pressure to adapt, possibly reimagining zoning laws and development guidelines to accommodate this new demand. The pivot towards larger homes could also influence the architecture and design industries, prompting a wave of innovation in home layouts, building materials, and community planning.

Furthermore, the push for larger homes may exacerbate existing economic disparities, as the ability to afford more extensive living spaces is invariably tied to economic status. This raises critical considerations for economic planners and policymakers, who must balance the evolving preferences with the need for affordable housing options. They face the challenge of ensuring that the housing market remains inclusive, preventing the marginalization of those who cannot afford to participate in this shift towards larger properties.

On the economic front, this trend towards larger homes could stimulate sectors related to home construction, renovation, and furnishing, as consumers seek to upgrade or purchase new properties that align with their revised preferences. However, it also necessitates a nuanced understanding of the environmental impact, as larger homes typically consume more resources and energy, challenging sustainability goals [@citeUKPollution].
The increase in demand for larger homes, as indicated by the data, suggests a potential shift in housing preferences, possibly spurred by the recent pandemic, which emphasized the need for multifunctional living spaces that combine comfort with functionality. This shift reflects not only a preference for larger living spaces but also an adaptation to new realities—homes that can accommodate remote work, virtual schooling, and indoor recreation.

This evolving preference could have profound implications, affecting urban planning and infrastructure development. Urban areas, known for high-density living, may need to reconsider zoning laws and development guidelines to meet the growing demand for larger homes. This trend might also influence the architecture and design industries, inspiring innovations in home layouts, building materials, and community planning to cater to new living standards.

Additionally, the preference for larger homes could intensify economic disparities, as the ability to afford such spaces is closely linked to economic status. This dynamic presents a significant challenge for economic planners and policymakers who must ensure that the housing market remains accessible and that housing policies do not exclude those unable to afford larger homes.

Economically, this trend could boost industries related to home construction, renovation, and furnishing as consumers seek to enhance or acquire properties that match their new preferences. However, it also calls for a careful evaluation of the environmental impacts, as larger homes generally require more resources and energy, posing challenges to sustainability goals [@citeUKPollution]. This balance between accommodating consumer preferences and maintaining sustainability will be crucial for future policy and economic strategies in the housing sector.

The geographical scrutiny of housing price trends, as visualized through heat maps, uncovers pronounced disparities across various regions, painting a picture of an uneven economic landscape. Coastal regions, in particular, showcase escalated housing prices, reflecting the perennial axiom of real estate: location is everything. These areas, often hubs of economic activity and cultural appeal, have witnessed a burgeoning demand for housing, driven by urban sprawl and the aspirational allure associated with coastal living. This demand, juxtaposed with the naturally limited land availability, precipitates a competitive market where prices climb steadily.

This dichotomy in regional pricing not only highlights the intrinsic value ascribed to geographical desirability but also points to a broader narrative of urban migration and the clustering of amenities and opportunities in certain locales. The resulting price escalation may serve as a bellwether for infrastructural strain and the need for sustainable development practices. Policymakers and urban planners are thus tasked with interpreting these geographical insights to foster balanced growth, ensuring that development is neither environmentally detrimental nor exclusionary in its economic impact.

The insights gleaned from the geographical positioning of housing markets underscore the potential for strategic infrastructural investments. By pinpointing areas of rapid price growth, stakeholders can identify regions ripe for development or in need of policy interventions to temper the market. Moreover, the data can inform the allocation of resources to underserved areas, encouraging a more equitable spread of economic prosperity.
The geographical analysis of housing price trends, illustrated through heat maps, reveals significant disparities across different regions, depicting an uneven economic landscape. Particularly, coastal regions display elevated housing prices, embodying the enduring principle in real estate that location is paramount. These regions, often centers of economic and cultural activity, have experienced increasing demand due to urban expansion and the attractive notion of coastal living. This demand, coupled with the inherently limited availability of land, leads to a competitive market with steadily rising prices.

This regional pricing dichotomy not only emphasizes the value attributed to geographic desirability but also reflects wider trends of urban migration and the concentration of amenities and opportunities in specific areas. The consequent price increases may signal potential infrastructural challenges and the necessity for sustainable development strategies. Consequently, policymakers and urban planners are charged with using these geographical insights to promote balanced growth, ensuring that development is sustainable and does not disproportionately impact economically.

The insights derived from the geographical distribution of housing markets highlight opportunities for strategic infrastructural investments. Identifying areas with rapid price growth allows stakeholders to pinpoint locations primed for development or in need of policy adjustments to stabilize the market.

As presented in @fig-GAM_fit, the numbers in the parentheses, like 10.83 and 2.74, represent smoothing parameters or effective degrees of freedom, which control the wiggliness of the spline. The y-axis values themselves, which range from negative values to positive values, indicate the contribution of the smooth term to the predicted value of the response variable. For instance, if you're modeling house prices, the y-axis might indicate how much the year or the number of bedrooms increases or decreases the predicted price of a house, relative to some baseline. The solid line in the plot is the estimated smooth curve, and the dashed lines typically represent confidence intervals around the estimated smooth.
In @fig-GAM_fit, the numbers in the parentheses, such as 10.83 and 2.74, represent the smoothing parameters or effective degrees of freedom. These parameters control the flexibility of the spline, balancing the fit of the model against the risk of overfitting by adjusting the "wiggliness" of the curve. The values on the y-axis, which range from negative to positive, quantify the contribution of each smooth term to the predicted value of the response variable, such as house prices. For example, these y-axis values might illustrate how changes in the year or the number of bedrooms influence the predicted house price, relative to a certain baseline.

The solid line depicted in the plot is the estimated smooth curve, which shows the modeled relationship between the predictor and the response variable. The dashed lines surrounding the solid line typically represent confidence intervals, providing a range within which the true effect is likely to lie with a certain level of confidence. This visualization helps in understanding the certainty of the model predictions and the potential variability in the effect of each predictor on the response variable.
